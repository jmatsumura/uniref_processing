# uniref_processing

These scripts aim to refine a UniRef dataset to just the 
UniProt entries that meet a certain threshold of evidence.

This is all processed through the 'build_map_phase_X.py' scripts
and their various stages. These need to be run in succession of one
another as the output of 1 is input for 2 and so on.
